A very first game that i made.

I use only Java for this project with javafx as graphic library.

# This game is designed for 2 players.
- Run the jar file in ponggame/out/production/ponggame to run the game
- use w and s to control the first paddle
- use up and down to control the second paddle
- play until one of two player got 10 score
