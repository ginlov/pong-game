# Pong_game
A very first game that i made.

I use only Java for this project with javafx as graphic library.

# This game is designed for 2 players.
- Run the jar file in ponggame/out/production/ponggame to run the game.
- Use w and s to control the first paddle.
- Use up and down to control the second paddle.
- Game ends when one of two players get 10 points.
